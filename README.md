Introduction to Cheese Chompers 3D
Welcome to Cheese Chompers 3D, an exhilarating browser-based, animal-themed knockout game where you control a goofy rat in an intense free-for-all arena. Originally modded from the popular Crazy Cattle 3D, this version transforms the gameplay by replacing sheep with comical rats, introducing an entirely new interface and sound design, and delivering a cheese-fueled challenge like no other.

Built in Unity with WebGL technology, it offers fast-paced gameplay with innovative twists, like speed-boosting flips and unpredictable collisions. The game features a unique physics system that makes every match feel different, as rats bounce, flip, and collide in their quest for cheese-based supremacy.
